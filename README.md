# Number-Guessing-Game
A basic number-guessing game built with Python

This is my first project, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on how to improve my code.

Planned features:

1. Allowing the user to play multiple rounds of the game.
2. Adding a timer.
3. Implementing a hint system for a user if they are stuck.
